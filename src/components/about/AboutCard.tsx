        As a self-taught web developer with a passion for front-end
        technologies, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        through hands-on projects and self-directed learning. With a keen eye
        for detail and a dedication to creating intuitive user experiences, I am
        eager to bring my skills to a junior web development position. This
        portfolio showcases a selection of my projects, demonstrating my ability
        to create responsive, visually appealing, and functional websites.
